My first individual project github. The main branch runs a slideshow of graphics, which can be run on a Java IDE.

Other notable branches are the Pathing branch, robot branch, and betterUtilbranch.

Sorry about the github structure here, I was very new, and didn't know how anything worked.

If you have any questions, please contact me at this email.
